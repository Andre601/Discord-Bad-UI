Discord has changed their Android App from originally being made in Java/Kotlin, to be made with React now.<br>
Reasons for this move include the merging of the two app development teams to have one core team to work on both app distributions (Android and iOS).

However, as a result have [countless bugs appeared][android-bugs]{ target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferral" } which you could encounter without even forcing it.<br>
Some of these bugs [still exist months later][twitter-post]{ target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferral" } and new ones are discovered too.
