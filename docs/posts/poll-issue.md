**Update:** Discord has added a permission to disable Poll creation for server and channels.

After having it in a form of beta release has Discord started to publicly roll out their Poll feature to all servers.  
This poll feature, while decent, lacks proper ways of moderation, as [any user with `Send Message` channel permission can create a Poll without any way of preventing if](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/22163184112407-Polls-FAQ#h_01HSED5BPEDH4YYFVVCXQ2NKZ1){ target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferral noopener" }, opening the floodgates for possible channel spam.
