In a more recent update of the Android App can certain gifs cause the App to slow down (lag) significantly, while also [causing your smartphone to heat up][smartphone-heats-up]{ target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferral" }.

Additionally is the a11y (accessability) setting in the app to enable and disable auto-playing of gifs completely ignored when the gif is inside an Embed, resulting in gifs still playing in an embed while the setting has been turned off.

**2023 Update:** The issue of slowing down is still present to this day (08th of september 2023).
