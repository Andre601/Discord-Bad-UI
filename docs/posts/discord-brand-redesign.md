On the 13th of May 2021 did Discord [announce their new redesign][blog-post]{ target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferral" }, which included changes to a lot of things including their logo called "Clyde", their Watermark and colours used.<br>
This choice received quite a bit of backlash from people which also included complains about [accessability issues with the new colours][a11y-issues]{ target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferral" }.
