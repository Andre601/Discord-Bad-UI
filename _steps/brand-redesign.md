On the 13th of may did [Discord announce their new redesign][blog-post], which included changes to a lot of things, such as their Logo called "clyde" and even the Watermark.  
This decision encountered quite a bit of backlash, including complains about [possible a11y issues][a11y-issues] with the new contrasts and colour schemes.
