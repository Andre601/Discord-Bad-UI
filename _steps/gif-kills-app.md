In a more recent update of the Android app can certain gifs cause the app to slow down (lag) significantly, while also [making the phone heat up][app-issue].

In addition is the a11y (accessability) setting for auto-playing gifs ignored for gifs inside embeds, resulting in gifs playing while the setting is off.
