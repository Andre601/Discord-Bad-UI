# discordhasgoodui.design
> Just FYI: The Domain is meant to be in a sarcastic tone...

This is a small website I've made to list all the past and current decisions made by Discord that make the UI the god awful thing it sometimes is. Be it broken textures, wrong padding, weird theme choises, etc.

## Disclaimer
This is not meant as a personal attack against Discord. It's meant as a joke and to point out the flawed designs they often make (See Discord rebranding last year).

Please don't attack Discord for this. Instead suggest improvements to their design, because it's better to provide good feedback than simple hate.

## Submit entries
The [issue tracker](/issues) is used for submitting entries.  
Note that you don't have to only submit current/new design fails. Ones made in the past can also be submitted, will be added (when accepted) and automatically inserted into the page.

## Credits
This page uses the [Jekyll-timeline theme][theme] from [lukas-h]. Smaller modifications have been made to the design, but it is otherwise the same.

The website is inspired by the "[Twitter is Going Great!][tigg]" Website, go check them out!
