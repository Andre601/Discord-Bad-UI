Discord has changed their Android app from being made in Java/Kotlin to be made with React.  
The main reason was to remove the gap between the iOS and Android app to have a single team working on both platforms.

The result however, was a [huge collection of bugs][bugs-1] that could be encountered without any provocation on your end. Some of them still exist to this day and [new ones are encountered too][bugs-2].
