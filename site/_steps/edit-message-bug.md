Using a [specific Website](https://lingojam.com/Discord(edited)Glitch) someone can create a bugged "edited" message where the position of the `(edited)` tag is moved to wherever in the new message you set it.

![bugged (edited) position](/assets/images/edit-bug/normal-message.jpg "The message before it was edited.")
![bugged (edited) position](/assets/images/edit-bug/bugged-message.jpg "The edited message using the content provided by the aforementioned website.")
